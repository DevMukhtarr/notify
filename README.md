# Notify

Notify is a web application with a minimalistic design and multi-color background animation. The application has been updated with new styles applied to all components, enhancing the user interface and improving the user experience.

## Updates

- **Styling**: All components have been styled to create a more visually appealing and user-friendly interface. The application now features a minimalistic design with a multi-color background animation.

- **Deployment**: We have added scripts for automatic deployment using GitHub Actions. These scripts automate the deployment process, reducing manual effort and ensuring that the latest version of the application is always available to users.

## Deployment

The application is automatically deployed using GitHub Actions whenever changes are pushed to the main branch. The deployment process involves pushing the contents of the repository to the `gh-pages` branch, from where it is served to users.

Please refer to the `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file for more details on the deployment process.
